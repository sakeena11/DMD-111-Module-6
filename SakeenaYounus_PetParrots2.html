<h1>Pet Parrots</h1>
<p>I have two pet parrots! They are both green cheek conures, a species of parrots, but they are a bit different from each other. My older bird, Tota, is a yellow sided green cheek conure, while my other one, named Chotu, is a green cheek conure. Yellow sided green cheek conures are a sub-species  of green cheek conures, so they are extremely similar. If you would like to learn more about green cheek conures, click <a href="http://blogs.thatpetplace.com/thatbirdblog/2012/04/18/green-cheeked-conures-captive-care-and-natural-history/#.YWzz6NnMLRY">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Tota</h3>
<p>We have had Tota since she was 6 months old, and she turned 9 in March, so we've had her for quite a while! The funny thing about Tota is that her name literally means &quot;parrot.&quot; She doesn't talk much, the only words she says are &quot;Tota&quot; and &quot;Didi,&quot; which means older sister, and that's what she calls me!</p>

<h3>Chotu</h3>
<p>We got Chotu earlier this year when he was about 1.5 years old, and he just turned 2 in October! Like Tota, he doesn't talk much, and only says &quot;Chotu.&quot;  I don't believe their specific species is very well known for talking. Chotu literally means &quot;small,&quot; which is funny because he is already a little bit bigger than Tota, despite being much younger than her, but he still acts like a little toddler at times.  </p>
